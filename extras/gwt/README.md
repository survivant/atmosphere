FAQ
---
1.  Question: Why do I get a serialization exception?  
    Answer: The most common causes are:
		- You didn't include your object in the SerialTypes your Serializer class
		- Your object to be serialized is not serializable
		- Your object has references to types that are too generic or are pulling in references to generic types.
 
2.	Question: Can you have multiple windows open to one session?  
	Short answer: Yes  
	Long answer: the atmosphere-gwt component does not provide an implementation for sessions, unlike gwt-comet. 
	This leaves the session specific code open to the creativity of the user. So you are not inhibited to implement 
	your own application specific session code on top of atmospere-gwt.
	Atmosphere-gwt is also able to track the individual window connections and you can send information to each specific 
	window and also know from which it is coming.
