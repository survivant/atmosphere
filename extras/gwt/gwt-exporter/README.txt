
This is the GWT Exporter module courtesy of Timepedia.org.  This module
allows you to expose GWT classes, methods, and fields as Javascript
objects and takes care of marshalling GWT objects back and forth
between the Javascript interface and the GWT interface.

Right now, there's no build files, because we use a cross platform
Maven configuration that depends on an internal repository that hosts
all of the GWT library permutations. I welcome anyone who wants to
provide working ANT/Maven build files that will work 'out of the box'
or with minimum end user hassle.

Also, unit tests are another area that needs work.

There is no documentation right now, but see the samples directory
for example usage. The exporter source itself is heavily commented.

You can also read the Timepedia blog, http://timepedia.blogspot.com
